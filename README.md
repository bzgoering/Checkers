Standard recreation of player vs player checkers.

Rules are mostly the same:
  Bottom (Blue) goes first 
  only forward diagonal moves are allowed
  valid moves are final (no undo)
  multi taking of peices are allowed
  
How to take a peice: 
  move peice to desired peice to jump, 
  then move peice again to desired tile. 
  Any invalid moves will reset your turn. 

Future updates
  player vs computer with a very basic algorithm
    takes peice if available, random plays otherwise
  Code clean up with debug
